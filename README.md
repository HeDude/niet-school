# NOT-school
Unconscious learning in a playground
Regulating learning by AI
## Introduction
The NOT-school is an innovative educational concept that transcends the traditional boundaries of school buildings and standardized curricula. The concept is based on a learning environment in which the learner does not feel like they are in a school, but rather in a playground where they can play freely. The focus is on unconscious learning, where the conscious learning process and the associated educational functions (feedback, monitoring, practice, testing, learning activities, etc.) are regulated by the environment.

## Method
The NOT-school is primarily a virtual environment, which can later also be made physical. The environment is designed to regulate learning in a conscious way under the hood, by having the best learning processes and associated functions for education take place through an expert system. This includes learning objectives, feedback, monitoring, practice, testing, learning activities, and much more.

The environment is built and filled with multi-modal AI, so that human interaction is fully tailored to the learner. The AI is capable of translating this interaction into educational language or learning language, in both directions - from the learner and to the learner. The interaction itself is multimodal, including text, image, and sound, and is structured in a game-like structure.

Together with the AI, we also develop an educational language. We build an expert system that has translated the content of, for example, everything in the [LE-Book](https://le-network.nl/) into expert rules and applies these rules from the educational language and generates educational language from this application that the AI translates back into human interaction to the learner. The learner is only unconsciously aware of this, except when learning to learn itself is part of the learning objectives.

## Implementation
Although the NOT-school is currently a virtual environment, there is the potential to make it physical in the future. The virtual playground can be converted into a physical space, allowing students to learn in a comfortable, playful environment. This approach to learning could help reduce the stress and pressure traditionally associated with education, and could contribute to creating a more engaged, enthusiastic, and creative generation of learners. Our goal is to create an environment that feels as natural as possible, and that enables students to learn in a way that suits them best.

## Game-Based Learning
Game-based learning is an integral part of the NOT-school, where AI can enhance the learning process by enabling adaptive learning. This means that the learning content and the learning game are automatically and constantly adjusted to the skills and understanding of the learner, based on their input.
